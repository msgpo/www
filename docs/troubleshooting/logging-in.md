There are a number of problems that can keep you from logging into your account.

## Custom servers

When upgrading to Turtl v0.7, your "Saved servers" are lost. This is an
unfortunate consequence of the upgrade, and means you'll have to set up the
servers you use again.

### Framanotes

The most common non-default server is Framanotes. Please try [connecting to Framanotes](https://framanotes.org/)
if you are having problems logging in!

## Forgot password

If you forgot your password, the best we can do is remove the account and let
you sign up again. We could give you direct access, but without knowing the
password you wouldn't be able to decrypt any of your data anyway.

Once again, we cannot reset your password.

Please use a password manager.
