	<h1>Turtl premium</h1>
	<p>
		The Turtl service is free and in most cases should work for most users.
		However, beginning soon, Turtl will launch a Premium service that will
		include more storage and will unlock various features in the Turtl apps.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the meantime while we figure out what our Premium service will offer,
		please <a href="/donate"><strong>consider making a donation to aid in Turtl's development!</strong></a>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you want the total freedom and security of Turtl without paying us,
		you are more than free to <a href="/docs/server/">run your own Turtl server.</a>
